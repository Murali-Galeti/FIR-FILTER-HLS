# FIR-FILTER-HLS
# FIR Filter Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter** using C and High-Level Synthesis (HLS) techniques for Xilinx FPGAs.

## Overview

The FIR filter is implemented in `fir.c` and tested using a testbench in `main.c`. The filter processes input signals and applies a given set of coefficients to generate the output. The project is designed to be synthesized using Xilinx Vivado HLS.

## FIR Filter Implementation

The `fir.c` file contains the FIR filter function:
- **Shift Register Implementation:** A delay line is used to store previous input samples.
- **Multiplication & Accumulation:** The function applies a set of coefficients to compute the filter output.
- **Loop Optimization:** The function includes pragmas (commented out) for loop unrolling and array partitioning for better performance on FPGA.

## Testbench

The testbench in `main.c` performs the following steps:
1. Reads input signal values from `input.dat`.
2. Calls the `fir()` function to process each input sample.
3. Writes the filtered output to `out.dat`.
4. Compares the generated output with `out.gold.dat` to verify correctness.

### Running the Testbench

1. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o fir_test main.c fir.c
   ```
2. **Run the Test:**
   ```bash
   ./fir_test
   ```
3. **Compare Output:**
   ```bash
   diff -w out.dat out.gold.dat
   ```
   If there are no differences, the output is correct.

## Debugging Tips

- Ensure that `input.dat` is formatted correctly (one integer per line).
- Verify that the file paths in `fopen()` are correct.
- Uncomment the `#pragma HLS` directives when synthesizing for FPGA.
- Print intermediate values in `main.c` to check signal processing.
